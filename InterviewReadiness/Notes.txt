CPython choses both Compilation and Interpretation depending on the stage of the execution process

Compilation: When you write Python code and run it -->
1. The source code (.py) file is first compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode (.pyc file)
2. The bytecode is lower representation but still not a machine code
Interpretation: After Python code is compiled into bytecode, it is executed by Python Virtual Machine (PVM) which is an interpreter.
1. The PVM read the bytecode and executes it line-by-line at runtime

Thus Python is considered as an Interpreted Language
